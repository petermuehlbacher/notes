    "\n",
    "While \"uniformly distributed\" sounds like something that should be easy to analyze it's actually a non-trivial task to get uniform samples in a systematic (and somewhat efficient) way. Fortunately computer scientists already had to devise means to do so and [Arnold et al's paper][3] provided the following handy formula for the probability of having to go up being at \"time\" $t$ and height $h$:\n",

    "\n",
    "In the following it is helpful to think of this construction of uniform Dyck paths as a random walk in a potential supported in a triangle with repelling boundary effects.\n",

    "\n",
    "In particular we have a strong upwards drift when we're close to $h=0$ and a strong downwards drift when we're close to $2k-t-h=0$ -- play around a bit, taking different limits in $p_{t,h}$! E.g. $p_{t,h}\\approx \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{2k-t-h}{2k-t}<\\frac{1}{2}$ for large $h$ and $p_{t,h}\\approx \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{h+2}{h+1}>\\frac{1}{2}$ for small $h$.\n",
